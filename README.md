# AlBrowser

## About 
This is my fork of [Al Browser](https://github.com/alefesouza/al-browser-uwp) project for some RnD (Tabs, Pane, etc.).

It's the simple browser for Universal Windows Platform in C#.

The developer (Alefe Souza) developed it initially to earn points in Microsoft TechRewards. Nice theme, indeed :)

[Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nblggh5hlw4) link broken at now. I'm glad to find the src code of Al Browser 

## My 2 (or 3?) cents
- Win SDK 18xxx -> 10240 (Astoria compatibility)
- It have History and Favorites using database, tabs, and is available in [E]nglish, [P]ortuguese, and [R]ussian (new).
- I "hard-coded" ya.ru as Home (Start) Page.
